## What is Frigg

***Meaning of Frigg**:* Goddess of wisdom and crafts

### **TL;DR**:
With Frigg, you provision **N-Kubernets** Clusters, which are **GitOps**-enabled and have **batteries included**.

Frigg is a cli project, to easily create one to one hundred 
of Kubernetes clusters on different hyperscalers.

**Since we relay heavenly on Cluster-API, we could implement any supported provider to _Frigg_\
[Check the supported Hyperscalers](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/providers)**

No matter which hyperscaler you choose, your kubernetes clusters will be
attached to one another, and are also GitOps enabled.

At the end, you will have N-amount of clusters, with a Github
repository for each of them, where you are able to add more applications deployments.

## Usage
### Requirements:

I am currently working on a preparing step, so you don't have two worry.\
But for now, the following needs to be done manually:

#### Install the following tools:

Just run:\
`frigg prepare`

All Tools we need, will be installed into the tools Directory under\
`~/.frigg/tools`

#### Get the *frigg* cli:
Get the binary using go:
```
go install github.com/PatrickLaabs/frigg@latest
```

```
curl -L -o frigg.tar.gz https://github.com/PatrickLaabs/frigg/releases/download/1.0.2/frigg_1.0.2_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
tar -xf frigg.tar.gz
chmod +x frigg
./frigg version
```

or download the binary at the releasepage:\
[Frigg - Github Release Page](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs/frigg/releases)
 
Homebrew is on the way.

#### Start the deployment:

While everything gets bootstrapped and provisioned, the Frigg CLI \
also creates a working directory inside your home directory at
`$HOME/.frigg`

Inside this directory we will store every generated file, such as\
the private and public ssh keypairs, various manifests, etc.

**Set the environment variables:**

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=
export GITHUB_USERNAME=
export GITHUB_MAIL=
```

**Running Frigg:**

```
frigg provisions kubernetes cluster with capi and gitops in no-time

Usage:
  frigg [command]

Available Commands:
  bootstrap   bootstrap various clusters on different providers
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  delete      Deletes one of [cluster]
  help        Help about any command
  version     Prints the frigg CLI version
```

**Provision your first management cluster:**
``` sh
frigg bootstrap capd cluster
```
This might take a while, since we are doing some heavy lifting.

**Provision your workload cluster ontop:**
``` sh
frigg bootstrap capd workloadcluster
```

After the provisioning of your management cluster is ready,\
you can port-forward the argocd-server pod and login with:
```
User: admin
Password: frigg
```
