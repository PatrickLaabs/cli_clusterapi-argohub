## What is Frigg

***Meaning of Frigg**:* Goddess of wisdom and crafts

### **TL;DR**:
With Frigg, you provision **N-Kubernets** Clusters, which are **GitOps**-enabled and have **batteries included**.

Frigg is a cli project, to easily create one to one hundred 
of Kubernetes clusters on different hyperscalers.

[Check the supported Hyperscalers]

No matter which hyperscaler you choose, your kubernetes clusters will be
attached to one another, and are also GitOps enabled.

At the end, you will have N-amount of clusters, with a Github
repository for each of them, where you are able to add more applications deployments.

## Usage
### Requirements:

I am currently working on a preparing step, so you don't have two worry.\
But for now, the following needs to be done manually:

#### Install the following tools:

- [kind](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/kind#default)
- [k9s](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/k9s#default)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [clusterctl](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/clusterctl#default)
- [kubectl](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/kubernetes-cli#default)
- [github cli](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gh#default)
- [jq](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq#default)

#### Get the *frigg* cli:
Get the binary using go:
```
go install github.com/PatrickLaabs/frigg@latest
```

```
curl -L -o frigg.tar.gz https://github.com/PatrickLaabs/frigg/releases/download/1.0.1/frigg_1.0.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
tar -xf frigg.tar.gz
chmod +x frigg
./frigg version
```

or download the binary at the releasepage:\
[Frigg - Github Release Page](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs/frigg/releases)
 
Homebrew is on the way.

#### Start the deployment:

While everything gets bootstrapped and provisioned, the Frigg CLI \
also creates a working directory inside your home directory at
`$HOME/.frigg`

Inside this directory we will store every generated file, such as\
the private and public ssh keypairs, various manifests, etc.

```

export GITHUB_USERNAME=
export GITHUB_MAIL=
```
