## What is Frigg

***Meaning of Frigg**:* Goddess of wisdom and crafts

### **TL;DR**:
With Frigg, you provision **N-Kubernets** Clusters, which are **GitOps**-enabled and have **batteries included**.

Frigg is a cli project, to easily create one to one hundred 
of Kubernetes clusters on different hyperscalers.

No matter which hyperscaler you choose, your kubernetes clusters will be
